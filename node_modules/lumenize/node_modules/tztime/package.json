Maccherone, Jr.\n\n_Timezone transformations in the browser and node.js plus timezone precise timeline creation for charting._\n\n## Features ##\n\n* Transform into and out of any timezone using Olson timezone rules\n* Timezone rule files embedded in the minified browser package. No need to host them\n  seperately.\n* Create timezone precise time-series axis for charts\n\n  * Knockout weekends, holidays, non-workhours\n  * Work with timezone precision\n  * Work in any granularity\n\n    * Year, quarter, week, day, hour, etc.\n    * No more recording `2012-03-05T00:00:00.000Z` when you really just mean `2012-03-05`\n    * Create and use custom granularities: `R02I04-07` = Seventh day of fourth iteration in\n      second release\n\n* Tested - Over 450 tests\n* [Documented](http://lmaccherone.github.com/tzTime/docs/tztime-docs/index.html) - Robust\n  documentation\n* [DocTested](https://github.com/lmaccherone/coffeedoctest) - The examples will always match\n  the code because it fails automated testing when they don't\n\n## Credits ##\n\nAuthors:\n\n* [Larry Maccherone](http://maccherone.com)\n* Jennifer Maccherone\n\nUsed when running:\n\n* [timezoneJS](https://github.com/mde/timezone-js) - library for Olson\n  [tz file](http://www.twinsun.com/tz/tz-link.htm) parsing.  Although I haven't touched the\n  actual tz file parsing code, I have modified timezoneJS fairly significantly. The original \n  included a drop-in replacement for JavaScript's Date object which I have removed. I also \n  modified it to work on node.js and in the browser once \"browserified\" by bundling the tz \n  files.\n\nUsed when developing:\n\n* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)\n* [coffeedoctest](https://github.com/lmaccherone/coffeedoctest) (by Larry Maccherone)\n* [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit)\n* [browserify with fileify plugin (modified)](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)\n* [uglify-js](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)\n* [wrench](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/wrench-js)\n* [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)\n\n## Using from a browser ##\n\nIf you are using Lumenize, you don't need to do anything. The browser package for Lumenize includes tzTime. If you just\nwant to use tzTime without Lumenize, then you can either host it on your own site.\n\nThen:\n\n`var tzTime = require('./tzTime');`\n`var timeline = new tzTime.Timeline({startOn:'2012-01', endBefore:'2013-01'});`\n    \n## Installation for node.js usage ##\n\nTo install, run the following from the root folder of your project:\n\n`npm install tzTime --save`\n\n## Installation for development ##\n\nThe documentation system uses jsduck so you'll need to install that like this:\n\n`[sudo] gem install jsduck`\n\n## Documentation and source code ##\n\n* [API Documentation](http://lmaccherone.github.com/tzTime/docs/tztime-docs/index.html)\n* [Source Repository](https://github.com/lmaccherone/tzTime)\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n* 0.6.12 - 2014-01-18 Updated to the latest coffee-script and jsduck\n* 0.6.11 - 2013-08-30 Stopped doing chdir in timezone.js because it was breaking other uses\n* 0.6.10 - 2013-04-24 Restoring timezone-js.js that was removed with .gitignore\n* 0.6.9 - 2013-04-24 Fixed side effect bug issue #2\n* 0.6.8 - 2013-04-24 Uses JSON2 for IE7 compatibility\n* 0.6.6 - 2013-02-14 Updated to latest version of jsduckify\n* 0.6.5 - 2012-02-09 Documention fixes\n* 0.6.4 - 2013-02-07 Timezone is safely ignored when sending in strings without 'Z' at the \n  end. Also, made it an error to send in timeshifted string formats like '...+01:00'. \n* 0.6.3 - 2013-02-07 Made it an error to instantiate a Time object with an ISOString without a \n  timezone. Also, ignore timezone when sending a string without the ending 'Z' or '+01:00'\n* 0.6.2 - 2013-02-03 Expose utils for Lumenize usage\n* 0.6.1 - 2013-02-03 Fix Travis-CI badge\n* 0.6.0 - 2013-02-02 Original version when first broken out from [Lumenize](http://lmaccherone.github.com/Lumenize)\n\n## MIT License ##\n\nCopyright (c) 2011, 2012, 2013 Lawrence S.
