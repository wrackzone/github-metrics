class Timeline
  ###
  @class Timeline

  Allows you to specify a timeline with weekend, holiday and non-work hours knocked out and timezone precision.
  
  ## Basic usage ##

      {TimelineIterator, Timeline, Time} = require('../')

      tl = new Timeline({
        startOn: '2011-01-03',
        endBefore: '2011-01-05',
      })

      console.log(t.toString() for t in tl.getAll())
      # [ '2011-01-03', '2011-01-04' ]

  Notice how the endBefore, '2011-01-05', is excluded. Timelines are inclusive of the startOn and exclusive of the
  endBefore. This allows the endBefore to be the startOn of the next with no overlap or gap. This focus on precision
  pervades the design of the Time library.

  Perhaps the most common use of Timeline is to return a Timeline of ISOStrings shifted to the correct timezone.
  Since ISOString comparisons give the expected chronological results and many APIs return their date/time stamps as
  ISOStrings, it's convenient and surprisingly fast to do your own bucketing operations after you've gotten a Timeline
  of ISOStrings.

      console.log(tl.getAll('ISOString', 'America/New_York'))
      # [ '2011-01-03T05:00:00.000Z', '2011-01-04T05:00:00.000Z' ]

  ## More advanced usage ##
 
  Now let's poke at Timeline behavior a little more. Let's start by creating a more advanced Timeline:
  
      tl = new Timeline({
        startOn: '2011-01-02',
        endBefore: '2011-01-07',
        holidays: [
          {month: 1, day: 1},  # Notice the lack of a year specification
          '2011-01-04'  # Got January 4 off also in 2011. Allows ISO strings.
        ]
      })
      
  `workDays` is already defaulted but you could have overridden it.
  
      console.log(tl.workDays)
      # [ 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday' ]
      
  Another common use case is to get a Timeline to return child Timelines. You see, Timelines can be thought of as
  time boxes with a startOn and an endBefore. You might have a big time box for the entire x-axis for a chart
  but if you want to bucket raw data into each tick on the x-axis, you'll need to know where each sub-time box starts
  and ends.

      subTimelines = tl.getAll('Timeline')
      console.log((t.startOn.toString() + ' to ' + t.endBefore.toString() for t in subTimelines))
      # [ '2011-01-03 to 2011-01-05',
      #   '2011-01-05 to 2011-01-06',
      #   '2011-01-06 to 2011-01-07' ]

  Notice how the first subTimeline went all the way from 03 to 05. That's because we specified 04 as a holiday.
  Timelines are contiguous without gaps or overlap. You can see that the endBefore of one subTimeline is always the startOn
  of the next.
  
  Now, let's create a Timeline with `hour` granularity and show of the concept that Timelines also serve as time boxes by
  learning about the contains() method.
      
      tl2 = new Timeline({
        startOn: '2011-01-02T00',
        endBefore: '2011-01-07T00',
      })
      
  `startOn` is inclusive.
  
      console.log(tl2.contains('2011-01-02T00'))
      # true
      
  But `endBefore` is exclusive
  
      console.log(tl2.contains('2011-01-07T00'))
      # false
  
  But just before `endBefore` is OK
  
      console.log(tl2.contains('2011-01-06T23'))
      # true
  
  All of the above comparisons assume that the `startOn`/`endBefore` boundaries are in the same timezone as the contains date.

  ## Timezone sensitive comparisions ##
  
  Now, let's look at how you do timezone sensitive comparisions.
  
  If you pass in a timezone, then it will shift the Timeline boundaries to that timezone to compare to the 
  date/timestamp that you pass in. This system is optimized to the pattern where you first define your boundaries without regard 
  to timezone. Christmas day is a holiday in any timezone. Saturday and Sunday are non work days in any timezone. The iteration
  starts on July 10th; etc. THEN you have a bunch of data that you have stored in a database in GMT. Maybe you've pulled
  it down from an API but the data is represented with ISOString. You then want to decide if the ISOString
  is contained within the iteration as defined by a particular timezone, or is a Saturday, or is during workhours, etc. 
  The key concept to remember is that the timebox boundaries are shifted NOT the other way around. It says at what moment
  in time July 10th starts on in a particular timezone and internally represents that in a way that can be compared to
  an ISOString.
  
  So, when it's 3am in GMT on 2011-01-02, it's still 2011-01-01 in New York. Using the above `tl2` timeline, we say:
  
      console.log(tl2.contains('2011-01-02T03:00:00.000Z', 'America/New_York'))
      # false
      
  But it's still 2011-01-06 in New York, when it's 3am in GMT on 2011-01-07
      
      console.log(tl2.contains('2011-01-07T03:00:00.000Z', 'America/New_York'))
      # true

  constructor: (config) ->
    ###
    @constructor
    @param {Object} config

    @cfg {Time/ISOString} [startOn] Unless it falls on a knocked out moment, this is the first value in the resulting Timeline
      If it falls on a knocked out moment, it will advance to the first appropriate moment after startOn.
      You must specify 2 out of 3 of startOn, endBefore, and limit.
    @cfg {Time/ISOString} [endBefore] Must match granularity of startOn. Timeline will stop before returning this value.
      You must specify 2 out of 3 of startOn, endBefore, and limit.
    @cfg {Number} [limit] You can specify limit and either startOn or endBefore and only get back this many.
      You must specify 2 out of 3 of startOn, endBefore, and limit.
    @cfg {Number} [step = 1 or -1] Use -1 to march backwards from endBefore - 1. Currently any
       values other than 1 and -1 are not well tested.
    @cfg {String} [granularity = granularity of startOn or endBefore] Used to determine the granularity of the ticks.
      Note, this can be different from the granularity of startOn and endBefore. For example:

        {
          startOn: '2012-01', # Month Granularity
          endBefore: '2012-02', # Month Granularity
          granularity: Time.DAY # Day granularity
        }

    @cfg {String[]/String} [workDays =  ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']] List of days of the
      week that you work on. You can specify this as an Array of Strings (['Monday', 'Tuesday', ...]) or a single comma
      seperated String ("Monday,Tuesday,...").
    @cfg {Array} [holidays] An optional Array of either ISOStrings or JavaScript Objects (and you can mix and match). Example:

        [{month: 12, day: 25}, {year: 2011, month: 11, day: 24}, "2012-12-24"]

       Notice how you can leave off the year if the holiday falls on the same day every year.
    @cfg {Object} [workDayStartOn = {hour: 0, minute: 0}] An optional object in the form {hour: 8, minute: 15}.
      If minute is zero it can be omitted. If workDayStartOn is later than workDayEndBefore, then it assumes that you
      work the night shift and your work  hours span midnight.

      The use of workDayStartOn and workDayEndBefore only make sense when the granularity is "hour" or finer.

      Note: If the business closes at 5:00pm, you'll want to leave workDayEndBefore to 17:00, rather
      than 17:01. Think about it, you'll be open 4:59:59.999pm, but you'll be closed at 5:00pm. This also makes all of
      the math work. 9am to 5pm means 17 - 9 = an 8 hour work day.
    @cfg {Object} [workDayEndBefore = {hour: 24, minute: 60}] An optional object in the form {hour: 17, minute: 0}.
      If minute is zero it can be omitted.

    and then do groupBy operations with an OLAPCube.

class TimelineIterator
  ###
  @class TimelineIterator

  In most cases you'll want to call getAll() on Timeline. TimelineIterator is for use cases where you want to get the
  values in the Timeline one at a time.

  You usually get a TimelineIterator by calling getIterator() on a Timeline object.

  Iterate through days, months, years, etc. skipping weekends and holidays that you
  specify. It will also iterate over hours, minutes, seconds, etc. and skip times that are not
  between the specified work hours.

  ## Usage ##

      {TimelineIterator, Timeline, Time} = require('../')

      tl = new Timeline({
        startOn:new Time({granularity: 'day', year: 2009, month:1, day: 1}),
        endBefore:new Time({granularity: 'day', year: 2009, month:1, day: 8}),
        workDays: 'Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday',
        holidays: [
          {month: 1, day: 1},  # New Years day was a Thursday in 2009
          {year: 2009, month: 1, day: 2}  # Also got Friday off in 2009
        ]
      })

      tli = tl.getIterator()

      while (tli.hasNext())
        console.log(tli.next().toString())

      # 2009-01-05
      # 2009-01-06
      # 2009-01-07

  Now, let's explore how Timelines and TimelineIterators are used together.

      tl3 = new Timeline({
        startOn:new Time('2011-01-06'),
        endBefore:new Time('2011-01-11'),
        workDayStartOn: {hour: 9, minute: 0},
        workDayEndBefore: {hour: 11, minute: 0}  # Very short work day for demo purposes
      })

  You can specify that the tickType be Timelines rather than Time values. On each call to `next()`, the
  iterator will give you a new Timeline with the `startOn` value set to what you would have gotten had you
  requested that the tickType be Times. The `endBefore' of the returned Timeline will be set to the next value.
  This is how you drill-down from one granularity into a lower granularity.

  By default, the granularity of the iterator will equal the `startOn`/`endBefore` of the original Timeline.
  However, you can provide a different granularity (`hour` in the example below) for the iterator if you want
  to drill-down at a lower granularity.

      tli3 = tl3.getIterator('Timeline', undefined, 'hour')

      while tli3.hasNext()
        subTimeline = tli3.next()
        console.log("Sub Timeline goes from #{subTimeline.startOn.toString()} to #{subTimeline.endBefore.toString()}")
        subIterator = subTimeline.getIterator('Time')
        while subIterator.hasNext()
          console.log('    Hour: ' + subIterator.next().hour)

      # Sub Timeline goes from 2011-01-06T00 to 2011-01-07T00
      #     Hour: 9
      #     Hour: 10
      # Sub Timeline goes from 2011-01-07T00 to 2011-01-10T00
      #     Hour: 9
      #     Hour: 10
      # Sub Timeline goes from 2011-01-10T00 to 2011-01-11T00
      #     Hour: 9
      #     Hour: 10

  There is a lot going on here, so let's poke at it a bit. First, notice how the second sub-Timeline goes from the 7th to the
  10th. That's because there was a weekend in there. We didn't get hours for the Saturday and Sunday.

  The above approach (`tl3`/`tli3`) is useful for some forms of hand generated analysis, but if you are using Time with
  Lumenize, it's overkill because Lumenize is smart enough to do rollups based upon the segments that are returned from the
  lowest granularity Time. So you can just iterate over the lower granularity and Lumenize will automatically manage
  the drill up/down to day/month/year levels automatically.

      tl4 = new Timeline({
        startOn:'2011-01-06T00',  # Notice how we include the hour now
        endBefore:'2011-01-11T00',
        workDayStartOn: {hour: 9, minute: 0},
        workDayEndBefore: {hour: 11, minute: 0}  # Very short work day for demo purposes
      })

      tli4 = tl4.getIterator('ISOString', 'GMT')

      while tli4.hasNext()
        console.log(tli4.next())

      # 2011-01-06T09:00:00.000Z
      # 2011-01-06T10:00:00.000Z
      # 2011-01-07T09:00:00.000Z
      # 2011-01-07T10:00:00.000Z
      # 2011-01-10T09:00:00.000Z
      # 2011-01-10T10:00:00.000Z

  `tl4`/`tli4` covers the same ground as `tl3`/`tli3` but without the explicit nesting.
