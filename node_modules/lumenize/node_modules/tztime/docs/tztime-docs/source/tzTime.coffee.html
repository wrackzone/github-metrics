 * # tzTime #
 * 
 * _Timezone transformations in the browser and node.js plus timezone precise timeline creation for charting._
 * 
 * ## Features ##
 * 
 * * Transform into and out of any timezone using Olson timezone rules
 * * Timezone rule files embedded in the minified browser package. No need to host them
 *   seperately.
 * * Create timezone precise time-series axis for charts
 * 
 *   * Knockout weekends, holidays, non-workhours
 *   * Work with timezone precision
 *   * Work in any granularity
 * 
 *     * Year, quarter, week, day, hour, etc.
 *     * No more recording `2012-03-05T00:00:00.000Z` when you really just mean `2012-03-05`
 *     * Create and use custom granularities: `R02I04-07` = Seventh day of fourth iteration in
 *       second release
 * 
 * * Work in a particular granularity like day, week, month, or quarter and not worry about the fiddly bits of finer
 *   granularity. JavaScript&#39;s Date object forces you to think about the fact that the underlying representation is milliseconds
 *   from the unix epoch.
 * * Month is 1-indexed (rather than 0-indexed like Javascript&#39;s Date object)
 * * Date/Time math (add 3 months, subtract 2 weeks, etc.)
 * * Work with ISO-8601 formatted strings (called &#39;ISOString&#39; in this library)
 * 
 *    * Added: Quarter form (e.g. 2012Q3 equates to 2012-07-01)
 *    * Not supported: Ordinal form (e.g. 2012-001 for 2012-01-01, 2011-365 for 2012-12-31) not supported
 * 
 * ## Granularity ##
 * 
 * Each Time object has a granularity. This means that you never have to
 * worry about any bits lower than your specified granularity. A day has only
 * year, month, and day segments. You are never tempted to specify 11:59pm
 * to specify the end of a day-long timebox.
 * 
 * Time supports the following granularities:
 * 
 * * `year`
 *     * `month`
 *         * `day`
 *             * `hour`
 *                * `minute`
 *                    * `second`
 *                        * `millisecond`
 *     * `quarter` (but not quarter_month, day, etc.)
 *     * `week` (ISO-8601 style week numbering)
 *        * `week_day` (Monday = 1, Sunday = 7)
 * 
 * Also, you can define your own custom hierarchical granularities, for example...
 * 
 * * `release`
 *    * `iteration`
 *       * `iteration_day`
 * 
 * ## Timezone precision ##
 * 
 * It&#39;s very hard to do filtering and grouping of time-series data with timezone precision.
 * 
 * For instance, 11pm in California on December 25 (Christmas holiday) is 2am December 26 (not a holiday)
 * in New York. This also happens to be 7am December 26 GMT. If you have an event that occurs at
 * 2011-12-26T07:00:00.000Z, then you need to decide what timezone to use as your context before you
 * decide if that event occured on Christmas day or not. It&#39;s not just holidays where this can burn you.
 * Deciding if a piece of work finished in one time range versus another can make a difference for
 * you metrics. The time range metrics for a distributed team should look the same regardless
 * of whether those metrics were generated in New York versus Los Angeles... versus Bangalore.
 * 
 * The javascript Date object lets you work in either the local time or Zulu (GMT/UTC) time but it doesn&#39;t let you
 * control the timezone. Do you know the correct way to apply the timezone shift to a JavaScript Date Object?
 * Do you know when Daylight Savings Time kicks in and New York is 4 hours shifted from GMT instead of 5? Will
 * you remember to do it perfectly every time it&#39;s needed in your code?
 * 
 * If you need this precision, Time helps by clearly delineating the moment when you need to do
 * timezone manipulation... the moment you need to compare/query timestamped data. You can do all of your
 * holiday/weekend knockout manipulation without regard to timezone and only consider the timezone
 * upon query submission or comparison.
 * 
 * ## Month is 1-indexed as you would expect ##
 * 
 * Javascript&#39;s date object uses 0 for January and 11 for December. Time uses 1 for January and 12 for December...
 * which is what ISO-8601 uses and what humans expect. Everyone who works with the javascript Date Object at one
 * point or another gets burned by this.
 * 
 * ## Week support ##
 * 
 * Time has ISO-8601 week support. Implications of using this ISO format (paraphrased info from wikipedia):
 * 
 * * All weeks have 7 days (i.e. there are no fractional weeks).
 * * Any given day falls into a single week which means that incrementing across the year boundary in week
 *   granularity is without gaps or repeats.
 * * Weeks are contained within a single year. (i.e. weeks are never spit over two years).
 * * The above two implications also mean that we have to warp the boundaries of the year to accomplish this. In week
 *   granularity dates may appear in a different year than you would expect and some years have 53 weeks.
 * * The date directly tells the weekday.
 * * All years start with a Monday and end with a Sunday.
 * * Dates represented as yyyyWww-d can be sorted as strings.
 * 
 * **In general, it just greatly simplifies the use of week granularity in a chart situation.**
 * 
 * The ISO-8601 standard is an elegant and well thought out approach to dealing with week granularity. The only real
 * downside to this approach is that USA folks expect the week to start on Sunday. However, the ISO-8601 spec starts
 * each week on Monday. Following ISO-8601, Time uses 1 for Monday and 7 for Sunday which aligns with
 * the US standard for every day except Sunday. The US standard is to use 0 for Sunday. This library says, &quot;tough luck&quot;
 * to folks who are unhappy that the week starts on Monday. Live with the fact that weeks in this library start on Monday
 * as they do in the ISO-8601 standard, or roll your own library. :-)
